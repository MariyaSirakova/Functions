Write a program that receives a sequence of numbers (integers) separated by a single space. It should print the min
and max values of the given numbers and the sum of all the numbers in the list. Use min(), max() and sum().

numbers = list(map(int,input().split()))

print(f"The minimum number is {min(numbers)}")
print(f"The maximum number is {max(numbers)}")
print(f"The sum number is: {sum(numbers)}")
