Write a function that receives two characters and returns a single string with all the characters in between them
(according to the ASCII code), separated by a single space. Print the result on the console.

def characters_line(first, second):
    new_string = []
    for curr_char in range(ord(first)+1, ord(second)):
        new_string.append(chr(curr_char))
    return new_string


first_letter = input()
second_letter = input()

print(*characters_line(first_letter,second_letter))
