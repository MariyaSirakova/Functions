Write a function that checks if a given password is valid. Password validations are:
• It should be 6 - 10 (inclusive) characters long
• It should consist only of letters and digits
• It should have at least 2 digits
If a password is valid, print "Password is valid".
Otherwise, for every unfulfilled rule, print a message:
• "Password must be between 6 and 10 characters"
• "Password must consist only of letters and digits"
• "Password must have at least 2 digits"


def check_password(some_password):
    is_valid = True
    if len(some_password) not in range(6, 11):
        print("Password must be between 6 and 10 characters")
        is_valid = False
    if not some_password.isalnum():
        print("Password must consist only of letters and digits")
        is_valid = False
    counter_of_digits = 0
    for char in some_password:
        if char.isdigit():
            counter_of_digits += 1
    if counter_of_digits < 2:
        print("Password must have at least 2 digits")
        is_valid = False
    return is_valid


password = input()
password_is_valid = check_password(password)

if password_is_valid:
    print("Password is valid")
