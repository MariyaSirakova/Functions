Write a function that receives two integer numbers. Calculate the factorial of each number.
Divide the first result by the second and print the division formatted to the second decimal point.

def factorial(number):
    for curr_number in range(1, number):
        number *= curr_number
    return number


first_number = int(input())
second_number = int(input())

first_num_factorial = factorial(first_number)
second_num_factorial = factorial(second_number)
result = first_num_factorial / second_num_factorial

print(f'{result:.2f}')
