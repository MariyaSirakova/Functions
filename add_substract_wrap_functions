You will receive three integer numbers.
Write functions named:
â€¢ sum_numbers() that returns the sum of the first two integers
â€¢ subtract() that returns the difference between the returned result of the first function and the third
integer
Wrap the two functions in a function named add_and_subtract() which will receive the three numbers as
parameters. Print the result of the subtract() function on the console.

def sum_numbers(first_num, second_num):
    return first_num + second_num

def subtract(sum, third_num):
    return sum - third_num

def add_and_subtract(number_1, number_2, number_3):
    sum_of_two_digits = sum_numbers(number_1, number_2)
    result = subtract(sum_of_two_digits, number_3)
    return result

num_1 = int(input())
num_2 = int(input())
num_3 = int(input())

print(add_and_subtract(num_1, num_2,num_3))
