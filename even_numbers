Write a program that receives a sequence of numbers (integers) separated by a single space. It should print a list of
only the even numbers. Use filter().

numbers = list(map(int,input().split()))

def even_numbers(n):
    return n % 2 == 0

even_list = list(filter(even_numbers, numbers))

print(even_list)
